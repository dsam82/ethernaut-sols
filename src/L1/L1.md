# L1

## Libraries

This level is using `SafeMath` from OZs to use basic functions for math operations to prevent overflow and underflow. These checks are now part of Solidity itself after v0.8.0.

## Ownable

`OnlyOwner` modifier restrics the access to public contracts to just the owner of the contracts.

## Fallback Functions

use `receive` fallback function to send ether to contract and take control of the ownership. Before that use `contract.contribute()` to send ether to a contract through a `payable` function.
